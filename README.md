## What is this?
This is an application that allows you to manage tasks.

## Why did I make this?
I wanted to develop something using python. Also, to learn the basics of development.

## What I focused on
I learned html, javascript, and css so that it wouldn't look boring, made the tasks look like cards, and had random pictures as background.
